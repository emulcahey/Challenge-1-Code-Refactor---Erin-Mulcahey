# Div-Change-Up
Challenge: clean up. February.29.2024

## Description

Accesability and cleaner code are benneficial to all. This code was used as a challenge to focus on using semantics for div and to clean up the code. I learned what semantics would work best for certin div sections, then I implimented by ideas and created a cleaner code. This challenge has helped by letting me focus solely on cleanup with out focusing on building code.

## Installation

N/A

## Usage

With out changing how the code displays in a browser, all the div sections were renamed to a semantic that describes the section and what the section is for.
